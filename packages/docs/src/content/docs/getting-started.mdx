PolicyGen is a way to codify your privacy and terms of service policies and auto-generate great looking pages for your website.

## Quick Start

### Installation

You can use PolicyGen by installing a local copy into your node modules or using npx.

```bash title="npm"
npm install --save-dev policygen
```

### Configuration

You will need to create a `policygen.json` configuration file for each project. 
This is necessary to specify the specifics policies that your company implements.

To create the `policygen.json` file, run the `init` command in the root folder of your project.

```bash title="npm"
npx policygen init
```

The init function will walk you through answering a bunch of policy questions in a wizard format, if you want to skip the wizard feel free to pass `--default` to emit a blank default `policygen.json` file instead.

### Generation

Once your `policygen.json` file is setup you can generate your policy files.

Generate takes flags to specify which policies you want to generate, default `:all`
